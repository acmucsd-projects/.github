# ðŸ’  ACM at UC San Diego

The Association for Computing Machinery, or ACM at UC San Diego is UC San Diego's largest members-first computing organization, 
with over 2,000 members and over 200 technical, professional, and social events year-round. Weâ€™re not just computing, though â€” we 
bring together anyone and everyone who shares our love of technology, design, and innovation!

ACM Projects is our quarterly projects program where students work in a tight knit team. The program gives students the opportunity to be hands-on outside of courses 
in fields such as AI, design, and software engineering. The program culminates in a projects showcase and the finished product looks great on resumes.
We welcome all skill levels to apply!
